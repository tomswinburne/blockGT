Figures showing fptd for different initial conditions at T=1 and T=10 for B->A
stat: stationary distribution for full B state
stat2: stationary distribution for B states for reduced GT system. aka same initial condition for full and GT
uni: uniform distribution across full B
uni2: uniform distribution across B states that exist in reduced GT system
globmin: all probability on globmin of state B
